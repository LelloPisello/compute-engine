so
CE
I seem to be extremely confused at to what this should be

so first off
the basic idea is

CeInstance
it contains everything vulkan needs to start writing command buffers
so stuff like best queue choices, a command pool, a logical device, and of course an instance 

on top of CeInstance you can build a CePipeline

a CePipeline is nothing more than a wrapper for a Compute pipeline,
it cannot be run by itself

CeCommand contains 
a command buffer 
a semaphore for signaling when the buffer is done
